This addon will show the Compact Raid Frames when solo.

 

It adds the following three slash commands (All do the same thing and toggle display of the Compact Raid Frame Manager)

/iwa 

/raidman 

/toggleraidman 

 

The last state of the manager frame will 

1. Be saved between sessions (per toon) 

2. Be shown automatically upon joining a group (you can use the command to hide it again)

3. Will restore to your last command chosen state upon leaving the group
